AVISIT may contain the visit names as observed (i.e., from SDTM VISIT), derived visit names, time window names, conceptual descriptions (such as Average, Endpoint, etc.), or a combination of any of these. AVISIT is a derived field and does not have to map to VISIT from the SDTM. AVISIT represents the analysis visit of the record, but it does not mean that the record was analyzed. There are often multiple records for the same subject and parameter that have the same value of AVISIT. ANLzzFL and other variables may be needed to identify the records selected for any given analysis. See ADaMIG v1.2, Section 3.3.8, for information about flag variables. AVISIT should be unique for a given analysis visit window. In the event a record does not fall within any predefined analysis time- point window, AVISIT can be populated in any way that the producer chooses to indicate this fact (i.e., blank or ""Not Windowed""). The way that AVISIT is calculated, including the variables used in its derivation, should be indicated in the variable metadata for AVISIT. The values and the rules for deriving AVISIT may be different for different parameters within the same dataset. Values of AVISIT are producer-defined and are often directly usable in clinical study report (CSR) displays.",A

TRTP,Planned Treatment,Char,,Cond,"TRTP is a record-level identifier that represents the planned treatment attributed to a record for analysis purposes. TRTP indicates how treatment varies by record within a subject and enables analysis of crossover and other designs. Though there is no requirement that TRTP will correspond to the TRTxxP as defined by the record's value of APERIOD, if populated, TRTP must match at least one value of the character planned treatment variables in ADSL (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTSEQP, TRxxPGy).
As noted previously, at least one treatment variable is required even in non-randomized trials. This requirement is satisfied by any subject-level or record-level treatment variables (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTP, TRTA). Even if not used for analysis, any ADSL treatment variable may be included in the BDS dataset.",B
TRTPN,Planned Treatment (N),Num,,Perm,"Numeric representation of TRTP. There must be a one-to-one relationship between TRTPN and TRTP within a study.
TRTPN cannot be present unless TRTP is also present. When TRTP and TRTPN are present, then on a given record, either both must be populated or both must be null.",C
TRTA,Actual Treatment,Char,,Cond,"TRTA is a record-level identifier that represents the actual treatment attributed to a record for analysis purposes. TRTA indicates how treatment varies by record within a subject and enables analysis of crossover and other multi-period designs. Though there is no requirement that TRTA will correspond to the TRTxxA as defined by the record's value of APERIOD, TRTA must match at least one value of the character actual treatment variables in ADSL (e.g., TRTxxA, TRTSEQA, TRxxAGy).
As noted previously, at least one treatment variable is required. This requirement is satisfied by any subject-level or record-level treatment variables (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTP, TRTA). Even if not used for analysis, any ADSL treatment variable may be included in the BDS dataset.",B
TRTAN,Actual Treatment (N),Num,,Perm,"Numeric representation of TRTA. There must be a one-to-one relationship between TRTAN and TRTA within a study.

AVISITN,Analysis Visit (N),Num,,Perm,"umeric representation of AVISIT. Since study visits are usually defined by certain timepoints, defining AVISITN so that it represents the timepoint associated with the visit can facilitate plotting and interpretation of the values. Alternatively, AVISITN may be a protocol visit number, a cycle number, an analysis visit number, or any other number logically related to AVISIT or useful for sorting that is needed for analysis.
There must be a one-to-one relationship between AVISITN and AVISIT (i.e., AVISITN has the same value for each distinct AVISIT) within a parameter. A best practice is to extend the one-to-one relationship to within a study, but this is not an ADaM requirement. In the event that a record does not fall within any predefined analysis timepoint window, AVISITN can be populated in any way that the producer chooses to indicate this fact (e.g., may be null). Values of AVISITN are producer-defined.
AVISITN cannot be present unless AVISIT is also present. On a given record, AVISITN cannot be populated if AVISIT is null. AVISITN can be null when AVISIT is populated, as long as the one-to-one relationship is maintained within a parameter on all rows on which both variables are populated.",C

ATPT,Analysis Timepoint,Char,,Cond,"The analysis timepoint description; required if an analysis is done by nominal, assigned or analysis timepoint (instead of or in addition to by-visit). Timepoints are relative to ATPTREF. ATPT may contain the timepoint names as observed (i.e., from SDTM --TPT), derived timepoint names, time window names, conceptual descriptions (such as Average, Endpoint, etc.), or a combination of any of these. This variable is often used in conjunction with AVISIT. ATPT represents the analysis timepoint of the record.",B

This variable is often used in conjunction with AVISIT. ATPT represents the analysis timepoint of the record.",C
PARAM,Parameter,Char,,Req,"The description of the analysis parameter. PARAM must include all descriptive and qualifying information relevant to the analysis purpose of the parameter.
Some examples are: ""Supine Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg)"", ""Log10 (Weight (kg))"", ""Time to First Hypertension Event (Days)"", and ""Estimated Tumor Growth Rate"". PARAM should be sufficient to describe unambiguously the contents of AVAL and/or AVALC.
Examples of qualifying information that might be relevant to analysis, and are therefore candidates for inclusion in PARAM, are units, specimen type, location, position, machine type, and transformation function. There is no need to include qualifiers that are not relevant to the analysis of PARAM. In contrast to SDTM --TEST, no additional variable is needed to further qualify PARAM.
PARAM is restricted to a maximum of 200 characters. If the value of PARAM will be used as a variable label in a transposed dataset, then the producer may wish to limit the value of PARAM to 40 characters. Such limitation to 40 characters should not compromise the integrity of the description.
PARAM is often directly usable in Clinical Study Report displays. Note that in the ADaMIG, ""parameter"" is a synonym of ""analysis parameter.""
PARAM must be present and populated on every record in a BDS dataset.",A
PARAMCD,Parameter Code,Char,,Req,"The short name of the analysis parameter in PARAM. The values of PARAMCD must be no more than 8 characters in length, start with a letter (not underscore), and be comprised only of letters (A-Z), underscore (_), and numerals (0-9). These constraints will allow for a BDS dataset to be transposed in such a way that the values of PARAMCD can be used as valid ADaM variable names per Section 3.1.1, General Variable Conventions. There must be a one-to-one relationship between PARAM and PARAMCD within a dataset.
PARAMCD must be present and populated on every record in a BDS dataset.",A
PARAMN,Parameter (N),Num,,Perm,"Numeric representation of PARAM. Useful for ordering and programmatic manipulation. There must be a one-to-one relationship between PARAM and PARAMN within a dataset for all parameters where PARAMN is populated.
if PARAMN is populated on any record for a PARAM, it must be populated on every record for that PARAM.",C
AVAL,Analysis Value,Num,,Cond,"Numeric analysis value described by PARAM. On a given record, it is permissible for AVAL, AVALC, or both to be null. AVAL is required if AVALC is not present, since either AVAL or AVALC must be present in the dataset.",B
DTYPE,Derivation Type,Char,(DTYPE),Cond,"Analysis value derivation method. DTYPE is used to denote, and must be populated, when the value of AVAL or AVALC has been imputed or derived differently than the other analysis values within the parameter. DTYPE is required to be populated even if AVAL and AVALC are null on the derived record.
Three common situations when DTYPE should be populated:
• A new row is added within a parameter with the analysis value populated based on other rows within the parameter.
• A new row is added within a parameter with the analysis value populated based on a constant value or data from other subjects.
• An analysis value (AVAL or AVALC) on an existing record is being replaced with a value based on a pre-specified algorithm.
DTYPE is used to denote analysis values that are ""special cases"" within a parameter. For each value of DTYPE, the precise derivation algorithm must be defined in analysis variable metadata, even for DTYPE values in the CDISC Controlled Terminology. The controlled terminology for DTYPE is extensible. See Section 4, Implementation Issues, Standard Solutions, and Examples for for examples of the use of DTYPE.
Some examples of DTYPE values: 
- LOCF = last observation carried forward
- WOCF = worst observation carried forward
- AVERAGE = average of values",B
